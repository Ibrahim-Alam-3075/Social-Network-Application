# Social-Network-Application

## Project Description
Welcome to the repository for our Social Media App, crafted meticulously in C++ and Qt Creator. This application leverages the full spectrum of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly social media experience. The application simulates a social networking platform where users can interact with each other, share posts, like content, and comment on posts.

## Features
